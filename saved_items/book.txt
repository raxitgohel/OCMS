hello friends to the world of books today the book that we have chosen for review is
0:21
thank you for being late well of course the very title of it suggests the interest that it carries
0:28
normally you're sorry if you're late but the author has certain reasons to thank his friends while they were late
0:34
they'll come a bit later first a little bit about the author arthur's earlier work was the world is
0:40
flat thomas friedman is a new york times columnist and a world known author american author who writes about
0:47
technology and about current affairs and if thomas hobbes that great
0:53
philosopher he was known for three words the expression that's made by nasty
0:58
brutish and short that the world was then to thomas friedman the world now is hot
1:05
flat and crowded that forms the title of his another book so earlier known for
1:10
his two books the world is flat and hot flat and crowded now the new book of thomas friedman that we are
1:17
going to discuss today is thank you for being late the great thing about this book is that
1:24
it's not actually a discourse against technology certainly because thomas friedman
1:29
symbolizes he represents he takes us into the into the depth of that great
1:35
technological change that has you know or taken taken the world by by surprise and the
1:42
greatest revolution so far that has happened in human history in fact he teaches us
1:47
how to grapple with these challenges that technology has posed and has set in
1:53
front of us the book has four units the first is reflecting
1:59
the second is accelerating the third is innovating
2:05
and the fourth is anchoring
2:10
the first reflecting i begin with a line it's not from this book it's it's from a
2:18
book that's titled when the heart waits that can go as an epigraph waiting provides the time and space
2:26
necessary for grace to happen and the second line rest is just as holy as work
2:34
now see the comparison between the rest and the work so that is why i chose these lines that
2:39
will do like like two epigraphs to the note on the book the main book by thomas
2:45
friedman thomas friedman in the in the very beginning pages of the book makes a very
2:51
subtle difference between human mind and a computer mind the mind of a
2:57
machine and the mind of a human being friedman actually quotes his friend and
3:02
teacher again a known researcher and a writer on technology doorside man he
3:08
writes when you press the pause button on a machine it stops
3:13
but when you press the pause button on human beings they start
3:19
therein lies the difference that is what he calls as reflection
3:24
what comes from the heart enters the heart that's called reflection
3:31
when empathy begets empathy when care begets care that's called reflection and
3:37
reflection is something that's badly missing in in an atmosphere in a world when we are being hugely bombarded by so
3:44
many sources of information from all sides and that is the real worry of acceleration that thomas friedman talks
3:51
about in detail in his book author talks actually about what we can
3:56
call as attention crisis because our attention spans are getting shorter and
4:02
shorter and shorter we get very very little time to reflect so that justifies the title actually
4:09
there's a very small story behind the title thomas friedman says that when he was he was waiting his friends
4:17
get late and when his friends arrive some of the friend says that i got laid
4:22
because i got stuck in a jam the other says that i got laid because there's some other reason but friedman says that
4:30
why are you sorry for being late actually i have to thank you for being late because by the time you
4:36
reached you gave me some time to reflect to think to ponder that is something
4:43
that counts as a blessing in this time of speed and acceleration so there he
4:49
gets the title for his book thank you for being late because while researching for his book
4:55
he had to interview some people many times over and over and
5:00
over again because by the time he would catch that information that information
5:06
would get obsolete then he would go to the next respondent then catch the next information and by the time he will put
5:12
that information in his book that data will go obsolete so by the time you take this
5:18
ice to your home it doesn't reach as ice it turns water so that is the biggest
5:24
thing the biggest challenge in this age of technology so that is the first unit of the book
5:32
thank you for being late in the same unit what friedman suggests us are some creative ways to deal with
5:39
this monster of speed and with the abundance and with the
5:45
overarching effect of technology around us what he asks us to do is to widen our
5:50
aperture so that we can synthesize more and more perceptions this patience
5:57
you know ultimately is not the absence of speed patience to him is the space for
6:02
reflection and thought so that's why he asks us to widen a bit your aperture so that more and more things can go in
6:10
no matter we face difficult challenges but nothing in life is to be feared
6:16
it's only to be understood that's a takeaway you know that that's the real thing that this book teaches that now is
6:24
the time to understand more so that we can fear less
6:29
the second unit of this book is accelerating acceleration or speed has been a
6:36
perennial theme for poets for philosophers for historians and earlier
6:41
they would do a comparison between the east and the west by saying that east doesn't change and west changes all the
6:48
way through minute to minute as the great poet of urdu iqbal in one of his
6:55
famous verses said maghrib
7:00
zameer
7:09
that the core of the west is based in in market is deep in market the core of the
7:15
east is steeped in cave there it changes every moment here it doesn't change at
7:20
all but that definition of east and west is now flat because technology has rendered
7:27
it flat now the east and the west change every moment every time again and again over
7:33
and over courtesy technology that definition had had had roots in history in anthropology in civilization
7:41
this definition has its roots in technology so thomas friedman he begins this
7:48
section with the year 2007 because he calls this year as the
7:54
vintage year of history the speed of technology is so fast because earlier we had agriculture age when things would
8:01
move at a very snail space for hundreds of years together then we were into industrial age when things did change at
8:08
a relatively faster pace than the agriculture age but still not as fast as
8:13
it is happening in the age of technology where things change just not just in years or months or in weeks or in days
8:22
they just go on changing and we are not able to to meet that speed
8:27
that's the reason that he says that 2007 was a vintage year of history because that was the year when according to
8:35
friedman machines were made to compete connect and collaborate
8:41
when facebook didn't exist i'm talking about before 2007 it's not bc it's not you
8:48
know it's not a it's not a medieval age it's just a few years less than two decades earlier
8:55
when facebook did not exist when twitter was just a sound
9:00
when skype was considered as a typo when cloud had no other meaning except
9:06
cloud itself these now are called as good old times it's not the time of our forefathers
9:13
it's the time that we have lived in and we have traveled through today
9:18
given the speed that we have it looks like a medieval age thomas friedman begins with
9:25
gordon moore's law you know the the real the real origin from where the speed
9:31
arises moore's law is simple one rice grain on a chessboard
9:38
you double it and then you go on multiplying go on multiplying and see what happens it has
9:44
a snowballing effect first we had megabytes and then we
9:49
traveled over to gigabytes and now we are in two terabytes and over to who
9:55
knows what next that is the race that is the pace of the speed that we are caught in
10:01
now humans have become a force of nature that are changing the planet at a pace
10:06
never so fast in human history now the challenge is how to strike a balance
10:14
that question is answered in detail by friedman
10:19
now the author says that i have a trick for you in fact i will refer you to somebody who can do it
10:25
for you friedman says and that's that's a brilliant way of saying it that's a creative way you'll really love it the
10:32
way he refers to someone who can do it for you who can control this change who
10:37
can stabilize you author says i know a woman who can sustain this balance for
10:42
you and the woman has been doing it for 3.8 billion years
10:48
guess who there's a woman an author says the name of that woman is
10:54
mother nature and mother nature loves being late so
11:00
you don't have to hurry you don't have to keep pace with everything that's going on around you just relax
11:06
lean back rest wait make some grace to happen because that is what mother nature
11:12
demands thomas friedman says the 20th century the century gone by that went into
11:19
saving mother nature from people but this 21st century will go in saving
11:26
mother nature for people see the difference because mother nature
11:32
is now under threat that mother nature is to be saved for
11:37
people because our own race is endangered because of those changes that
11:43
that technology that climate change has brought about so friedman says that there is only one person or one thing or
11:50
one character whatever you like to call it that is mother nature mother nature can can save you
11:58
because the challenge is too huge too immense it's on it's not just this that we are getting fascinated by new gadgets
12:04
by by the new pace by the new things by the new consumption epidemic that all of
12:10
us are becoming a victim of there are certain things that we consider that if they are not saved if they are not
12:16
stored if they are not somehow produced or created or recreated the
12:22
entire human race will face such a big challenge and thomas friedman says that
12:27
we could rebuild europe after world war ii and to friedman that was much easier
12:35
we could rebuild economy after the great crash that again to friedman was a
12:41
little easier but once we overstep limits of mother nature
12:48
friedman says we can never rebuild the things we destroy here because once destroyed is always
12:55
destroyed it's not that theory of replenishing the the recreating the
13:00
natural resources because we are banking we are hanging we are spending on our
13:06
savings as friedman in one of his earlier books the world is flat or
13:12
somewhere in hot flat and crowded also that idea echoes that we are actually
13:18
living or spending the credit card that belongs to our
13:24
generations so that is how we are destroying mother nature now thomas friedman says that mother
13:30
nature has what he calls as killer apps what thomas friedman calls killer apps
13:36
these killer apps are adaptability diversity
13:41
entrepreneurship ownership sustainability
13:47
bankruptcy federalism patience
13:52
and topside these are mother nature's killer apps and he suggests us to convert these
13:59
killer apps into human politics but given all mercy that mother nature
14:04
is known for we must never forget and he warns us that mother nature is
14:11
brutal mother nature you know she's compassionate she can save us but at the
14:17
same time the way we have waged a war against mother nature don't forget that
14:22
mother nature at the same time is merciless so that is the lesson that goes in the second part of this book and
14:29
over to the third one that is titled as innovating
14:34
friedman carries on the same theme of speed but here he talks about and here he takes us a little ahead and he gets
14:41
us into the different realms of of our practical life he says that education will change its
14:48
meaning the the employment will change its meaning because earlier what we would call as
14:55
digital divide friedman says that digital divide is past now what we are facing is motivational divide it's been
15:02
replaced by that because in this age learning is more important than knowing earlier we would
15:09
say that if we if we if we don't know but now we say that if we don't learn to
15:15
know that's how the employment the job market that learning the teaching
15:20
everything is going uh is suffering or is experiencing a
15:26
radical change in itself so friedman stresses the need to widen the scope of
15:33
learning not not for just individuals but but for nations
15:39
for corporate hats for politicians for heads of the states the key lies in the learning because
15:47
we can't always curse our luck because we have been thrown behind we have to curse ourselves and he he he
15:54
gives the allegory of of a golfer that if you if you're not able to hit your
16:00
ball that the problem does not lie with your stick or with your ball the problem lies with you it's
16:06
your responsibility to learn the newer things so that you can you can meet the newer challenges
16:13
that are offered to you so that is how he says that the scope of learning is actually the whole thing
16:20
learning is all if shakespeare said ripeness is all friedman may though he
16:26
doesn't mention shakespeare in that context that friedman may say that learning is
16:32
all friedman further explains and then devises some some ways some means to
16:37
meet this challenge again that's what friedman calls it it's just too damn fast because at today's rate of
16:45
progress he says 21st century will be equivalent to 20 000 years of progress
16:52
imagine what do we do now there's a challenge should we press
16:57
the pause button no not here he sets it he sets two options that
17:03
should should we stop the speed or should we increase our speed to match the speed of the progress
17:10
i have a small example and by means of that i understand this phenomenon there's a horse and a horseman the horse
17:17
is too slow and the horseman is worried about the slow pace of his horse
17:22
he feeds it with a steroid now the horse gets faster now horsemen faces the speed
17:28
of the horse is too fast now what does he do he takes a steroid of a bigger dose but doesn't feed it to the horse
17:35
takes it himself why because he must be always one step ahead of the horse horse
17:41
must follow him not that the man will follow the horse the horse will follow the man so the
17:47
same thing applies here how do you balance a fast technological process
17:53
with a relatively slower sense of humanity that's the challenge that friedman puts and that is the solution
18:00
that friedman suggests now the solution is what friedman finds a term as a solution that
18:08
the term is called dynamic stability he gives the example of a kayak you know
18:14
there's a sport that's called kayaking when you're in a fast roving boat
18:19
you don't have to stick your paddle you don't have to stick your kayak sticking your kayak means
18:25
that your boat will come to a halt no that's not to be done this whole thing is not to be stopped
18:31
friedman asks us to adjust yourself to the speed so that you don't crash
18:37
against the wave stopping is no solution at all
18:42
we have to learn to have a balance between physical technology and social technology the two
18:50
terms that friedman coins what is physical technology physical technology is simple that's the
18:56
technology of gadgets and the progress that is happening in the world every day every week every month our gadgets get a
19:03
bigger higher speed at a much cheaper faster rate but what is social technology
19:11
the the normal technology we understand but the social technology is the bulwark
19:16
that is the defense against that fast changing technology that is too blinding social technology as friedman puts is
19:23
the rule of law social technology is social institutions social technology is ethics it's the
19:30
social structures that is the the embodiment of all these things put together the strengthening of
19:37
all these institutions that thomas friedman puts as social technology because we have to
19:43
run parallel to the change we don't have to stop the change from happening that's not possible and that's not desirable
19:51
that phenomenon of marrying social technology to physical technology will stabilize us
19:58
and that phenomenon thomas friedman calls co-evolution that's a beautiful term
20:05
there's a new social contract in fact this is russo revisited
20:11
you know we are redefining the rules of employability of this age now you know we have to live in this
20:17
human capital where everything is driven by by market forces by technology so
20:23
thomas friedman suggests certain things that how to restore yourself the balance
20:28
how to take rest also how to do work also how to learn also how to unlearn
20:34
also it's not all about learning the new it's also about unlearning the old so
20:40
here are three key social contracts which thomas friedman talks about the
20:46
first one is between workers and employees just see
20:51
the second is between students and institutions and the third one is between citizens
20:58
and government now see this contract and understand it and explain it and describe it in such a
21:06
way so that there's a harmonious relationship between the social technology and the physical technology
21:12
there's a great upheaval in fact there's a great search a new phenomenon that is taking world by
21:20
surprise and that we never know that the things that is that it it's going to do
21:25
in future that phenomenon is called ai artificial intelligence
21:32
earlier machines competed at a manual level with human beings now they will compete at a cognitive
21:39
level that's what artificial intelligence is all about now meeting
21:45
the challenge of artificial intelligence that's called ai thomas friedman suggests us something
21:51
really very interesting he reverses the words he says that you can meet ai
21:57
with ia that he calls it intelligent assistance because actually artificial
22:03
intelligence is not the master that has got to be your slave the same relationship between
22:10
the horse and the horseman the same relationship between the master and a slave as to who drives whom
22:16
artificial intelligence should not drive a human being a human being has to drive
22:22
artificial intelligence that is why he says that this ai artificial intelligence is to be converted into
22:29
what he calls it intelligent assistance and what is intelligent assistance
22:34
it is the interface between humans and their tools
22:39
ai is creating your own knowledge and inventing your own career that is how
22:47
thomas friedman phrases the long and short of artificial intelligence that
22:52
how to meet that challenge also because we have to ultimately understand the concept of freedom in the age of
23:00
technology what he stresses is that we don't have to get enslaved by technology
23:05
rather we have to come over and mount it and write it and and turn it to the best
23:12
possible use for humankind so friedman calls this phenomenon of imbalance as
23:19
inequality of freedom you know russians would say it's easier
23:24
to turn an aquarium into a fish soup than to turn a fish soup into an aquarium that's that's the gross
23:31
inequality now friedman talks about two free freedoms here
23:37
it's not the clash of freedoms it is the difference of freedoms one is called freedom from
23:43
and the other is called freedom to freedom from is a process that's far
23:50
quicker but freedom too takes time those who will read that book will find
23:55
in detail as to how he expects on or how he dwells upon these two different
24:01
concepts of freedom from and freedom to that has been discussed by earlier philosophers as well but he talks in it
24:08
talks about these two con concepts in technological and in social context
24:14
like like friedman says that social media is good for collective sharing
24:20
it's good for collective building and he says for it's good for collective
24:26
destruction but it's not good for collective construction that's what thomas friedman says about the pace the
24:33
blinding pace that social media has come for because of speed and brevity as he puts
24:40
that we write our opinion in just 140 characters on such complex world affairs
24:47
that is what we do right now we write an opinion in in a line in two lines and characters so
24:54
the concept of freedom needs to be more nuanced it's not that plain it's not the
24:59
freedom of just coining the slogan it has to be more subtle it has to be more nuanced it has to be full of shades it's
25:06
not about the freedom of extremes it is about the 50 shades of grey that come in
25:12
between the age of acceleration as is mentioned in this book it will be a graveyard as
25:18
what is uh thomas friedman for big ideas the the ideas have gone missing in this
25:24
speed and that's a worry that is why he thanks his friends for being late because ideas were going
25:31
missing and he was into retrieving those ideas that had gone
25:37
buried somewhere in the maze and haze of this abundance or speed and that perhaps
25:44
is the reason that makes thomas friedman call internet as a as an open sewer of
25:51
untreated information what a phrase that's a beautiful way of defining
25:57
that's that's certainly not going against the changes or the other or the great things that internet has come in
26:03
its wake the greatest the greatest revolution in human history but see how how friedman phrases it as a
26:10
sewer of untreated information but what he suggests is that we need to treat it well if it's untreated we have
26:17
to treat it well it's not the problem with the internet it's the problem with the use of the internet that is where
26:23
the point of authentication or veracity of filtering comes
26:28
and he says that earlier if it would take a village to raise a child
26:34
now it takes a planet to do the same just imagine because the birth of a baby
26:39
is not just the birth of an individual it's the birth of a cosmos because he carries a microcosm he carries the
26:46
symbol of that cosmos because ultimately it's the whole climate that supports the birth of a baby
26:54
the fourth and the last unit of this book is called anchoring it's not that usual marketplace or
27:02
professional television or radio anchoring that we call it's anchoring
27:07
finding your roots that's called anchoring the first thing that will make us anchor
27:14
to the ground is what thomas friedman calls he's got some such a beautiful way of phrasing
27:20
abstract concepts into simple and graceful things see how does he call it he calls that anchoring a legal
27:28
performance enhancing drug what is that legal performance enhancing drug that's called trust
27:36
and he says it's trust that will keep us anchored that will keep us tethered to the ground once we
27:43
lose that we lose everything more the world branches out
27:48
more we need to be anchored through this what through this performance enhancing drug
27:56
that's called the trust because ultimately trust is the glue that binds
28:01
us in this age of pace and speed and and abundance and plethora of things we have
28:07
to trust each other because technology has created some issues of trust of suspicion of of of of
28:17
endangering of our privacy as human beings so ultimately we will have to place our reliance on each other
28:24
what more will keep us anchored friedman says apart from trust in
28:30
friedman's words there are certain things we can't download and that is the key point that we need
28:36
to understand as students of technology in friedman's words there are certain
28:42
things that we can't download the high five from a coach
28:47
the praise from a mentor the hug from a friend the hand up
28:53
from a neighbor the handshake from a rival the
28:58
totally unsolicited gesture of kindness from a stranger
29:03
the smell of a garden and not the cold stare of a wall these
29:09
things are completely irreplaceable and if technology gives us anything he says
29:15
that i don't need i don't need icons on the facebook i need friends i need those friends who i can see and
29:22
be with whose company i can enjoy not on the screen as a small window or a mug
29:27
shot but whose company i can share who can sit with me talk to me face to face
29:33
that is how he says that there are certain things which technology can't replace there are certain things that
29:38
you can't download friendship you can't download company of course you can have virtual company but virtual company in
29:45
no way by no means is the replacement to the real company that you can enjoy as
29:51
human beings now thomas friedman shifts his attention to america and he says that there are
29:57
diseases and diseases but the biggest disease today in america
30:02
is not cancer it's isolation which makes anchoring impossible
30:09
and friedman also has a solution to this friedman portrays minnesota his own
30:16
place as a sample of that humanity he craves for
30:22
to meet this global challenge he offers this what he calls as
30:27
interesting again he calls it as a refresher course this is a refresher course for humanity and see how he
30:34
phrases that how he explains that refresher course friedman says i needed to go back and reconnect to
30:42
that time and place in my life where politics worked where community spirit was real
30:49
where public institutions were respected where my friends were my friends not
30:54
followers on twitter or icons on facebook the author is in search of a real world
31:02
that goes in harmony with the virtual world he is neither an optimist
31:08
nor a pessimist and he says both are forms of fatalism what he believes in
31:15
he calls it applied hope so let us apply that hope to the world we live in
31:21
though the post-corona world the post-covet world poses some great threats some
31:27
great challenges to us and it seems that the real world may now be replaced by
31:32
the virtual world but the reality stays and stays forever
31:37
since this book thank you for being late has been written before koid kovid
31:42
erupted before world was taken over by corona but it will pose
31:48
some new questions it will pose some new problems but still the themes that are everlasting
31:54
are really everlasting the last message that thomas friedman gives is that be
32:00
tethered to a place called home and don't worry if that gets you late so
32:06
finally we are back to homes at least this bit gets true that in post-corona crisis
32:13
all of us wish each other a line a message that is stay home
32:20
stay safe and stay blessed that's what friedman suggests that's
32:25
what we suggest thank you very much
33:01
you
