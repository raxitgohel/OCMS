hello friends to the world of books today the book that we have chosen for review is thank you for being late well of course the very title of it suggests the interest that it carries normally you're sorry if you're late but the author has certain reasons to thank his friends while they were late they'll come a bit later first a little bit about the author arthur's earlier work was the world is flat thomas friedman is a new york times columnist and a world known author american author who writes about technology and about current affairs and if thomas hobbes that great philosopher he was known for three words the expression that's made by nasty brutish and short that the world was then to thomas friedman the world now is hot flat and crowded that forms the title of his another book so earlier known for his two books the world is flat and hot flat and crowded now the new book of thomas friedman that we are going to discuss today is thank you for being late the great thing about this book is that it's not actually a discourse against technology certainly because thomas friedman symbolizes he represents he takes us into the into the depth of that great technological change that has you know or taken taken the world by by surprise and the greatest revolution so far that has happened in human history in fact he teaches us how to grapple with these challenges that technology has posed and has set in front of us the book has four units the first is reflecting the second is accelerating the third is innovating and the fourth is anchoring the first reflecting i begin with a line it's not from this book it's it's from a book that's titled when the heart waits that can go as an epigraph waiting provides the time and space necessary for grace to happen and the second line rest is just as holy as work now see the comparison between the rest and the work so that is why i chose these lines that will do like like two epigraphs to the note on the book the main book by thomas friedman thomas friedman in the in the very beginning pages of the book makes a very subtle difference between human mind and a computer mind the mind of a machine and the mind of a human being friedman actually quotes his friend and teacher again a known researcher and a writer on technology doorside man he writes when you press the pause button on a machine it stops but when you press the pause button on human beings they start therein lies the difference that is what he calls as reflection what comes from the heart enters the heart that's called reflection when empathy begets empathy when care begets care that's called reflection and reflection is something that's badly missing in in an atmosphere in a world when we are being hugely bombarded by so many sources of information from all sides and that is the real worry of acceleration that thomas friedman talks about in detail in his book author talks actually about what we can call as attention crisis because our attention spans are getting shorter and shorter and shorter we get very very little time to reflect so that justifies the title actually there's a very small story behind the title thomas friedman says that when he was he was waiting his friends get late and when his friends arrive some of the friend says that i got laid because i got stuck in a jam the other says that i got laid because there's some other reason but friedman says that why are you sorry for being late actually i have to thank you for being late because by the time you reached you gave me some time to reflect to think to ponder that is something that counts as a blessing in this time of speed and acceleration so there he gets the title for his book thank you for being late because while researching for his book he had to interview some people many times over and over and over again because by the time he would catch that information that information would get obsolete then he would go to the next respondent then catch the next information and by the time he will put that information in his book that data will go obsolete so by the time you take this ice to your home it doesn't reach as ice it turns water so that is the biggest thing the biggest challenge in this age of technology so that is the first unit of the book thank you for being late in the same unit what friedman suggests us are some creative ways to deal with this monster of speed and with the abundance and with the overarching effect of technology around us what he asks us to do is to widen our aperture so that we can synthesize more and more perceptions this patience you know ultimately is not the absence of speed patience to him is the space for reflection and thought so that's why he asks us to widen a bit your aperture so that more and more things can go in no matter we face difficult challenges but nothing in life is to be feared it's only to be understood that's a takeaway you know that that's the real thing that this book teaches that now is the time to understand more so that we can fear less the second unit of this book is accelerating acceleration or speed has been a perennial theme for poets for philosophers for historians and earlier they would do a comparison between the east and the west by saying that east doesn't change and west changes all the way through minute to minute as the great poet of urdu iqbal in one of his famous verses said maghrib zameer that the core of the west is based in in market is deep in market the core of the east is steeped in cave there it changes every moment here it doesn't change at all but that definition of east and west is now flat because technology has rendered it flat now the east and the west change every moment every time again and again over and over courtesy technology that definition had had had roots in history in anthropology in civilization this definition has its roots in technology so thomas friedman he begins this section with the year 2007 because he calls this year as the vintage year of history the speed of technology is so fast because earlier we had agriculture age when things would move at a very snail space for hundreds of years together then we were into industrial age when things did change at a relatively faster pace than the agriculture age but still not as fast as it is happening in the age of technology where things change just not just in years or months or in weeks or in days they just go on changing and we are not able to to meet that speed that's the reason that he says that 2007 was a vintage year of history because that was the year when according to friedman machines were made to compete connect and collaborate when facebook didn't exist i'm talking about before 2007 it's not bc it's not you know it's not a it's not a medieval age it's just a few years less than two decades earlier when facebook did not exist when twitter was just a sound when skype was considered as a typo when cloud had no other meaning except cloud itself these now are called as good old times it's not the time of our forefathers it's the time that we have lived in and we have traveled through today given the speed that we have it looks like a medieval age thomas friedman begins with gordon moore's law you know the the real the real origin from where the speed arises moore's law is simple one rice grain on a chessboard you double it and then you go on multiplying go on multiplying and see what happens it has a snowballing effect first we had megabytes and then we traveled over to gigabytes and now we are in two terabytes and over to who knows what next that is the race that is the pace of the speed that we are caught in now humans have become a force of nature that are changing the planet at a pace never so fast in human history now the challenge is how to strike a balance that question is answered in detail by friedman now the author says that i have a trick for you in fact i will refer you to somebody who can do it for you friedman says and that's that's a brilliant way of saying it that's a creative way you'll really love it the way he refers to someone who can do it for you who can control this change who can stabilize you author says i know a woman who can sustain this balance for you and the woman has been doing it for 3.8 billion years guess who there's a woman an author says the name of that woman is mother nature and mother nature loves being late so you don't have to hurry you don't have to keep pace with everything that's going on around you just relax lean back rest wait make some grace to happen because that is what mother nature demands thomas friedman says the 20th century the century gone by that went into saving mother nature from people but this 21st century will go in saving mother nature for people see the difference because mother nature is now under threat that mother nature is to be saved for people because our own race is endangered because of those changes that that technology that climate change has brought about so friedman says that there is only one person or one thing or one character whatever you like to call it that is mother nature mother nature can can save you because the challenge is too huge too immense it's on it's not just this that we are getting fascinated by new gadgets by by the new pace by the new things by the new consumption epidemic that all of us are becoming a victim of there are certain things that we consider that if they are not saved if they are not stored if they are not somehow produced or created or recreated the entire human race will face such a big challenge and thomas friedman says that we could rebuild europe after world war ii and to friedman that was much easier we could rebuild economy after the great crash that again to friedman was a little easier but once we overstep limits of mother nature friedman says we can never rebuild the things we destroy here because once destroyed is always destroyed it's not that theory of replenishing the the recreating the natural resources because we are banking we are hanging we are spending on our savings as friedman in one of his earlier books the world is flat or somewhere in hot flat and crowded also that idea echoes that we are actually living or spending the credit card that belongs to our generations so that is how we are destroying mother nature now thomas friedman says that mother nature has what he calls as killer apps what thomas friedman calls killer apps these killer apps are adaptability diversity entrepreneurship ownership sustainability bankruptcy federalism patience and topside these are mother nature's killer apps and he suggests us to convert these killer apps into human politics but given all mercy that mother nature is known for we must never forget and he warns us that mother nature is brutal mother nature you know she's compassionate she can save us but at the same time the way we have waged a war against mother nature don't forget that mother nature at the same time is merciless so that is the lesson that goes in the second part of this book and over to the third one that is titled as innovating friedman carries on the same theme of speed but here he talks about and here he takes us a little ahead and he gets us into the different realms of of our practical life he says that education will change its meaning the the employment will change its meaning because earlier what we would call as digital divide friedman says that digital divide is past now what we are facing is motivational divide it's been replaced by that because in this age learning is more important than knowing earlier we would say that if we if we if we don't know but now we say that if we don't learn to know that's how the employment the job market that learning the teaching everything is going uh is suffering or is experiencing a radical change in itself so friedman stresses the need to widen the scope of learning not not for just individuals but but for nations for corporate hats for politicians for heads of the states the key lies in the learning because we can't always curse our luck because we have been thrown behind we have to curse ourselves and he he he gives the allegory of of a golfer that if you if you're not able to hit your ball that the problem does not lie with your stick or with your ball the problem lies with you it's your responsibility to learn the newer things so that you can you can meet the newer challenges that are offered to you so that is how he says that the scope of learning is actually the whole thing learning is all if shakespeare said ripeness is all friedman may though he doesn't mention shakespeare in that context that friedman may say that learning is all friedman further explains and then devises some some ways some means to meet this challenge again that's what friedman calls it it's just too damn fast because at today's rate of progress he says 21st century will be equivalent to 20 000 years of progress imagine what do we do now there's a challenge should we press the pause button no not here he sets it he sets two options that should should we stop the speed or should we increase our speed to match the speed of the progress i have a small example and by means of that i understand this phenomenon there's a horse and a horseman the horse is too slow and the horseman is worried about the slow pace of his horse he feeds it with a steroid now the horse gets faster now horsemen faces the speed of the horse is too fast now what does he do he takes a steroid of a bigger dose but doesn't feed it to the horse takes it himself why because he must be always one step ahead of the horse horse must follow him not that the man will follow the horse the horse will follow the man so the same thing applies here how do you balance a fast technological process with a relatively slower sense of humanity that's the challenge that friedman puts and that is the solution that friedman suggests now the solution is what friedman finds a term as a solution that the term is called dynamic stability he gives the example of a kayak you know there's a sport that's called kayaking when you're in a fast roving boat you don't have to stick your paddle you don't have to stick your kayak sticking your kayak means that your boat will come to a halt no that's not to be done this whole thing is not to be stopped friedman asks us to adjust yourself to the speed so that you don't crash against the wave stopping is no solution at all we have to learn to have a balance between physical technology and social technology the two terms that friedman coins what is physical technology physical technology is simple that's the technology of gadgets and the progress that is happening in the world every day every week every month our gadgets get a bigger higher speed at a much cheaper faster rate but what is social technology the the normal technology we understand but the social technology is the bulwark that is the defense against that fast changing technology that is too blinding social technology as friedman puts is the rule of law social technology is social institutions social technology is ethics it's the social structures that is the the embodiment of all these things put together the strengthening of all these institutions that thomas friedman puts as social technology because we have to run parallel to the change we don't have to stop the change from happening that's not possible and that's not desirable that phenomenon of marrying social technology to physical technology will stabilize us and that phenomenon thomas friedman calls co-evolution that's a beautiful term there's a new social contract in fact this is russo revisited you know we are redefining the rules of employability of this age now you know we have to live in this human capital where everything is driven by by market forces by technology so thomas friedman suggests certain things that how to restore yourself the balance how to take rest also how to do work also how to learn also how to unlearn also it's not all about learning the new it's also about unlearning the old so here are three key social contracts which thomas friedman talks about the first one is between workers and employees just see the second is between students and institutions and the third one is between citizens and government now see this contract and understand it and explain it and describe it in such a way so that there's a harmonious relationship between the social technology and the physical technology there's a great upheaval in fact there's a great search a new phenomenon that is taking world by surprise and that we never know that the things that is that it it's going to do in future that phenomenon is called ai artificial intelligence earlier machines competed at a manual level with human beings now they will compete at a cognitive level that's what artificial intelligence is all about now meeting the challenge of artificial intelligence that's called ai thomas friedman suggests us something really very interesting he reverses the words he says that you can meet ai with ia that he calls it intelligent assistance because actually artificial intelligence is not the master that has got to be your slave the same relationship between the horse and the horseman the same relationship between the master and a slave as to who drives whom artificial intelligence should not drive a human being a human being has to drive artificial intelligence that is why he says that this ai artificial intelligence is to be converted into what he calls it intelligent assistance and what is intelligent assistance it is the interface between humans and their tools ai is creating your own knowledge and inventing your own career that is how thomas friedman phrases the long and short of artificial intelligence that how to meet that challenge also because we have to ultimately understand the concept of freedom in the age of technology what he stresses is that we don't have to get enslaved by technology rather we have to come over and mount it and write it and and turn it to the best possible use for humankind so friedman calls this phenomenon of imbalance as inequality of freedom you know russians would say it's easier to turn an aquarium into a fish soup than to turn a fish soup into an aquarium that's that's the gross inequality now friedman talks about two free freedoms here it's not the clash of freedoms it is the difference of freedoms one is called freedom from and the other is called freedom to freedom from is a process that's far quicker but freedom too takes time those who will read that book will find in detail as to how he expects on or how he dwells upon these two different concepts of freedom from and freedom to that has been discussed by earlier philosophers as well but he talks in it talks about these two con concepts in technological and in social context like like friedman says that social media is good for collective sharing it's good for collective building and he says for it's good for collective destruction but it's not good for collective construction that's what thomas friedman says about the pace the blinding pace that social media has come for because of speed and brevity as he puts that we write our opinion in just 140 characters on such complex world affairs that is what we do right now we write an opinion in in a line in two lines and characters so the concept of freedom needs to be more nuanced it's not that plain it's not the freedom of just coining the slogan it has to be more subtle it has to be more nuanced it has to be full of shades it's not about the freedom of extremes it is about the 50 shades of grey that come in between the age of acceleration as is mentioned in this book it will be a graveyard as what is uh thomas friedman for big ideas the the ideas have gone missing in this speed and that's a worry that is why he thanks his friends for being late because ideas were going missing and he was into retrieving those ideas that had gone buried somewhere in the maze and haze of this abundance or speed and that perhaps is the reason that makes thomas friedman call internet as a as an open sewer of untreated information what a phrase that's a beautiful way of defining that's that's certainly not going against the changes or the other or the great things that internet has come in its wake the greatest the greatest revolution in human history but see how how friedman phrases it as a sewer of untreated information but what he suggests is that we need to treat it well if it's untreated we have to treat it well it's not the problem with the internet it's the problem with the use of the internet that is where the point of authentication or veracity of filtering comes and he says that earlier if it would take a village to raise a child now it takes a planet to do the same just imagine because the birth of a baby is not just the birth of an individual it's the birth of a cosmos because he carries a microcosm he carries the symbol of that cosmos because ultimately it's the whole climate that supports the birth of a baby the fourth and the last unit of this book is called anchoring it's not that usual marketplace or professional television or radio anchoring that we call it's anchoring finding your roots that's called anchoring the first thing that will make us anchor to the ground is what thomas friedman calls he's got some such a beautiful way of phrasing abstract concepts into simple and graceful things see how does he call it he calls that anchoring a legal performance enhancing drug what is that legal performance enhancing drug that's called trust and he says it's trust that will keep us anchored that will keep us tethered to the ground once we lose that we lose everything more the world branches out more we need to be anchored through this what through this performance enhancing drug that's called the trust because ultimately trust is the glue that binds us in this age of pace and speed and and abundance and plethora of things we have to trust each other because technology has created some issues of trust of suspicion of of of of endangering of our privacy as human beings so ultimately we will have to place our reliance on each other what more will keep us anchored friedman says apart from trust in friedman's words there are certain things we can't download and that is the key point that we need to understand as students of technology in friedman's words there are certain things that we can't download the high five from a coach the praise from a mentor the hug from a friend the hand up from a neighbor the handshake from a rival the totally unsolicited gesture of kindness from a stranger the smell of a garden and not the cold stare of a wall these things are completely irreplaceable and if technology gives us anything he says that i don't need i don't need icons on the facebook i need friends i need those friends who i can see and be with whose company i can enjoy not on the screen as a small window or a mug shot but whose company i can share who can sit with me talk to me face to face that is how he says that there are certain things which technology can't replace there are certain things that you can't download friendship you can't download company of course you can have virtual company but virtual company in no way by no means is the replacement to the real company that you can enjoy as human beings now thomas friedman shifts his attention to america and he says that there are diseases and diseases but the biggest disease today in america is not cancer it's isolation which makes anchoring impossible and friedman also has a solution to this friedman portrays minnesota his own place as a sample of that humanity he craves for to meet this global challenge he offers this what he calls as interesting again he calls it as a refresher course this is a refresher course for humanity and see how he phrases that how he explains that refresher course friedman says i needed to go back and reconnect to that time and place in my life where politics worked where community spirit was real where public institutions were respected where my friends were my friends not followers on twitter or icons on facebook the author is in search of a real world that goes in harmony with the virtual world he is neither an optimist nor a pessimist and he says both are forms of fatalism what he believes in he calls it applied hope so let us apply that hope to the world we live in though the post-corona world the post-covet world poses some great threats some great challenges to us and it seems that the real world may now be replaced by the virtual world but the reality stays and stays forever since this book thank you for being late has been written before koid kovid erupted before world was taken over by corona but it will pose some new questions it will pose some new problems but still the themes that are everlasting are really everlasting the last message that thomas friedman gives is that be tethered to a place called home and don't worry if that gets you late so finally we are back to homes at least this bit gets true that in post-corona crisis all of us wish each other a line a message that is stay home stay safe and stay blessed that's what friedman suggests that's what we suggest thank you very much you
